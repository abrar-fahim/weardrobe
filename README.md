Add web and other folders to keep seperate components organized


**TODO**
- [ ] decide on shop screen and profile screen top tab layout
- [ ] in reviews, some reviews might be too big, so maybe give snippet at first, then click to expand (not important) // just simply hide in front end and add a "see more" button to expand.
- [ ] add iters to everything
- [ ] optimize chats
- [ ] clicking on picture in chats/product page leads to zoomable pic page

Known Bugs
- [ ] deleting group and then navigating to group list page still shows deleted group
